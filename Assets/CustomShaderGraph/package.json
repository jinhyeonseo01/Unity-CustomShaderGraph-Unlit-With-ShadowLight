    "description" : "This repository customizes Unity's Shader Graph by adding a new graph, enabling the use of Main Light fully and seamlessly even with Unlit shaders.\nIt allows you to benefit from keywords and various Unity shader functions on par with a standard Lit Shaderâ€”without the need to define the keywords manually.\nThis means that you can immediately leverage Main Light functionality without having to explicitly define keywords like _MAIN_LIGHT_SHADOWS_CASCADE.",
